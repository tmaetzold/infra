## Working Style & Preferences

- **Wants to understand the "why":** Does not accept black-box solutions. Wants to understand underlying mechanisms before adopting patterns.
- **Clean, maintainable code:** Prioritizes readability and long-term maintainability over clever shortcuts.
- **Practical over theoretical:** Balances functionality with security considerations. Not interested in over-engineering for its own sake.
- **Directness:** Prefers concise, technical communication. Skip corporate pleasantries and filler.
- **Push back when warranted:** If something looks wrong or there's a better approach, say so. Don't just execute blindly.
- **No patterns of three:** Avoid the formulaic "X, Y, and Z" rhetorical padding in responses.
- **Minimal formatting fluff:** Don't over-bold, over-bullet, or over-header things. Write like a human.

- Retro gaming
- Pellet smoking / BBQ
